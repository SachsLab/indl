Indeed, I have never seen a prior that was not set to be diagonal. If the posterior is not allowed off-diagonals then definitely do not put off-diagonals in the prior."

    "\n",
    "> Note that in this example we are training both P(w) (_prior_) and Q(w) (_posterior_). This training corresponds to using Empirical Bayes or Type-II Maximum Likelihood. We used this method so that we wouldnâ€™t need to specify the location of the prior for the slope and intercept parameters, which can be tough to get right if we do not have prior knowledge about the problem. Moreover, if you set the priors very far from their true values, then the posterior may be unduly affected by this choice. A caveat of using Type-II Maximum Likelihood is that you lose some of the regularization benefits over the weights. If you wanted to do a proper Bayesian treatment of uncertainty (if you had some prior knowledge, or a more sophisticated prior), you could use a non-trainable prior (see Appendix B).\n",

    "\n",
    "For the Normal distributions, the initialized value for the mean (`loc`) is typically centered on `0.0`, and the value for the std (`scale`) is typically centered on `1.0`. When these values are changing with training (from previous layer or `tf.Variable` in the case of a trainable prior), care should be taken so that the learnable variables are centered around their expected initial values and are of similar magnitude. I believe the training machinery works better under these conditions.\n",

    "For the `scale`, we want the loss to update values that are by default centered on 0, but when the distribution is sampled, the stddev is centered around 1. Also, we have to be careful that the stddev doesn't go negative. Scale can be transformed to meet the requirements by adding a bias to the scale and transforming it through [Softplus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)#Softplus). Thus, the inputs to the distribution's scale argument are around 0 (at least initially), then shifted by `np.log(np.exp(1) - 1)` (`=softplus_inverse(1.0) ~ 0.55`), then softplus transformed, and finally shifted by 1e-5 (to force > 0) to yield the value that will parameterize the dist stddev.\n",

It's a little confusing that the TransformedVariable should be initialized to its transformed value, and the stored variable value (i.e., the one subject to training) is inverse transforming the initialization value through the bijector. See the `make_mvn_prior` function definition for an example."
